						<h3><span class="unique" style="font-size: 24px;">Website portfolio</span></h3>
						<p>The most important part of building a brand online is having a responsive and well-built website. For that
						reason, I chose to make this portal page as a display of my website development skills and innovations.</p>
						<p>With this website, I was able to practice my website techniques such as content containters to ensure
						that my website isn't skewed when resized and can maintain it's beautiful design.</p>
						<p>I also used more advanced concepts like CSS functions to design my website header with linear
						gradients. Researching and using these functions was fun while challenging at first, I eventually achieved my goal through determination.</p>

						<span class="unique" style="font-size: 28px;">MineSavage Discord Bot</span>
						<p>I was approached by a representative from MineSavage to develop a custom and configurable Discord bot to automate
						some tasks and add additional features to their discord server.</p>
						<p>This was an application written in Python - while completing this project, I used JSON files to store data such as data and serialized objects, like channel IDs.</p>
						<p>I also used some OOP concepts; by using the Discord Cog Class as a super-class, I was able to load all commands and events on the bot's startup
						from the <code style="font-size: 17.5px; background-color: #e7e7e7">/cogs/</code> directory. My code became more modularised as I could simply iterate over my <code style="background-color: #e7e7e7">/cogs/</code> directory,
						if the Python file located didn't contain a <code style="font-size: 17.5px; background-color: #e7e7e7">setup()</code> function then it wouldn't be recognised and subsequently would be ignored.</p>
