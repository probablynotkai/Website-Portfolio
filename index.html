						<p>Hey there, my name is <span class="unique">Kai Harrison</span>, I am a 16-year-old, aspiring developer experienced in <span class="unique">Java and Python</span>.
						I was born and am currently living in the <span class="unique">West Midlands, England</span> with limited transport but ample opportunity for remote positions.</p>
						<p>I have been programming Java and several other languages for roughly <span class="unique">3 years</span> now and have come
						to the point where I can say that I am most proficient in Java, however, these aren't limitations to my skills.</p>
						<p>I had prior knowledge in <span class="unique">Python</span> attained by going to my school's CodeClub.
						In my spare time, to further consolidate my knowledge, I have completed SoloLearn Online Courses covering the languages
						Python and Java and successfully receieved my <span class="unique">SoloLearnÂ© Java & Python Tutorial Certificate</span> - after learning Java, I moved to more advanced projects implementing core skills like
						Maven dependency injection, GIT Version Control, database management and more.</p>
						<p>I have familiarised myself with Object-Oriented-Programming and the techniques & conventions associated with this paradigm.
						Additionally, as Python supports 4 paradigms, I have a familiarised myself with the programming conventions to be able to interpret code from any
						higher-level programming language.</p>

					<p><span class="unique" style="font-size: 32px;"><strong>Skills and qualities</strong></span></p>
					<p>I am a highly skilled developer with a wide scope of skills in different aspects of Computing.
					As of 2022, I am studying A-Level <span class="unique">Computer Science</span>, <span class="unique">I.T</span>, and <span class="unique">Digital Game Production</span> which gives
					me insight into all of the perfect subjects of knowledge for your next big project.</p>
					
					<p><span class="unique" style="font-size: 26px;"><strong>Why me?</strong></span></p>
					<p>Through my years at school and time spent doing extra curricular activities, I accrued a bundle of ideal characteristicts which could make you change your mind whether to click off of this page.
					In my childhood, I played a lot of Football allowing me to develop leadership skills - at that level of football, realistically it's more about character building than making the next superstar!</p>
					<span><span class="unique" style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center !important;">A list of my characteristics are:</span></br>- Self motivated mindset</br>- Ability to work under pressure</br>- Conflict resolution</br>- Efficient and effective communication</br>- Problem solving</span>
					
					<br />
					
					<p><span class="unique" style="font-size: 32px;"><strong>Personal interests</strong></span></p>
					<p>Up until the age of 16, I played football at a 'grass roots' level for the local Leamington Brakes Football Club. This 
					really sparked my interest for football, and ever since I've occasionally played the sport, additionally, I try to keep
					up-to-date with the latest news surrounding my favourite team, Arsenal.</p>
					<p>As a kid, I would always be on my computer, whether that would be watching YouTube videos or whether I would be trying to
					figure out how a part of a computer worked, I would always be around technology which brought my ambitions to life.
					Based on this childhood surrounding technology, I knew I wanted to make my career about it - to which I researched popular
					and upcoming computing roles, until I discovered software development and instantly knew I had found what I wanted to do with my life</p>
